    <h1>The Okavango Delta</h1>
    <p>The Okavango Delta is a unique pulsing wetland. More correctly an alluvial fan, the delta covers between 6 and 15 000 square kilometres of Kalahari Desert in northern Botswana and owes
      its existence to the Okavango (Kavango) River which flows from the Angolan highlands, across Namibia’s Caprivi Strip and into the harsh Kalahari Desert.
      Each year the Okavango River discharges approximately 11 cubic kilometres (1.1 × 10¹³ litres) of water into the Okavango Delta.
       Most of this water is lost to transpiration by plants (60%) and by evaporation (36%) with only 2% percolating into the aquifer system
       with the remainder finally flowing into Lake Ngami.
       <p>Our site is called Okavango Delta after a beautiful area in Botswana. Once in a year, this drought area is filled with water and all
       wildlife around goes to his exact place to drink water.
      They bypass hundreds of miles just for that. This resource, that we think we have a plenty of, is actually very limited. Nonetheless, many countries consume it very unconsciously.
       One of the reasons for that is non-effective industry that requires lot of water. Another reason – it’s actually very cheap.</p>
       <h3>Walking Safaris</h3>
       <p>The islands and flood plains of the Okavango Delta provide an excellent environment &amp;for first class walking safaris.
       These allow guests to get a much fuller experience of the delta, closer to the natural world. Participants develop an understanding of the scale and majesty of the African bush.
        Whilst most water based camps offer walking safaris as an activity, specialist walking safaris tailored for the African aficionado provide an authentic safari experience.</p>
        <h3>Riding Safaris</h3>
        <p>Exploring some of the most remote areas of the <strong>Okavango Delta</strong>, riding safaris allow you to really understand the scope of the delta. Catering for the competent rider the Okavango Delta’s three outfitters place a real emphasis on the safari experience with daily expeditions as well as the innovative use of fly camps even deeper in the delta.
         These are some of the best riding safaris in Africa and guests return year after year.</p>
